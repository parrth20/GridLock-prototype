# 🚦 ClearLane Bengaluru

### Clear the lane. Move the city.

**An evidence-led parking-congestion command centre that turns raw violation data into decisions an officer can act on — which junctions, in what order, and exactly when.**

</div>

> Built for **Flipkart Gridlock Hackathon 2.0**. ClearLane is an independent decision-support tool — **not an official government service**. It uses only the supplied, anonymised violation dataset; there are **no live CCTV, traffic-speed, or travel-time feeds**.

---

## The problem, in human terms

One scooter on a footpath. One cab stopped on a main road near a junction. The bus can't pull in, autos spill into the lane, and the green light clears nothing. Multiply that across a city and you get gridlock — but enforcement today is reactive, and there's no clear picture of *where* parking actually chokes traffic, or *when*.

ClearLane reads the city's own violation record and answers four questions the brief asks:

> **Find the hotspots → Measure the impact → Target enforcement → Plan for events.**

---

## Dataset foundation

Everything is computed from a single, auditable source — no invented locations, capacities, occupancy or travel times.

| What | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Supplied violation records | **298,450** |
| Police stations | **54** |
| Named junctions | **168** |
| Window | **Nov 2023 → Apr 2024** |

Every number on screen is tagged as **observed** (straight from the data), **calculated** (worked out by an engine), or **forecast** (projected) — so you always know what you're looking at.

## 🔄 How it works — the operator loop

ClearLane is built around how a control room actually thinks, not around dashboards for their own sake.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    O["👁️ Observe<br/>hotspot map"] --> U["🧩 Understand<br/>why a zone scores high"]
    U --> P["📋 Prioritise<br/>top zones + 'Do this now'"]
    P --> D["🚓 Deploy<br/>patrol & event plans"]
    D --> L["🔁 Learn<br/>compare against the record"]
    L --> O
```

And here's what happens the moment you click a junction:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Officer
    participant FE as Map (React + R3F)
    participant API as /api/hotspots/[id]
    participant RE as Risk engine
    U->>FE: Click a junction
    FE->>FE: Camera flies in
    FE->>API: Fetch detail
    API->>RE: Score + explain
    RE-->>API: Index, factors, window
    API-->>FE: Plain-language explanation
    FE-->>U: Drawer → "Add to patrol plan"
```

## ✨ Features

- **Cinematic 3D landing** — a Bengaluru-inspired city model with traffic-data trails and motion controls.
- **Real OpenStreetMap hotspot map** with a violation **heatmap**, plus a 3D view — click a junction, it flies in, and a drawer explains it.
- **Explainable Parking-Induced Congestion Risk Index** — a 0–100 score you can fully inspect.
- **Validated forecast model** — harmonic (Fourier) regression + weekday seasonality + Poisson intervals, reported with **out-of-sample accuracy** from leave-one-hour-out cross-validation (no in-sample inflation).
- **Constraint-based patrol planner** — ranks junctions for a shift and splits them across units, time-ordered.
- **Event planning** — staffing, barricade and diversion suggestions for rallies, matches and festivals.
- **ClearLane Sahayak** — a deterministic, dataset-grounded assistant (never invents anything, never issues challans).
- **Bring your own data** — upload a CSV and the maps *and* the model rebuild automatically.

### The risk index, decoded

| Factor | Weight | Plain meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Violation frequency | 30% | How many violations happen here vs. the busiest spot |
| Obstruction severity | 25% | Footpath / main-road / bus-stop parking counts as worse |
| Recurrence | 15% | Whether the problem keeps coming back |
| Junction proximity | 15% | How many other busy spots are within 1.5 km |
| Time-of-day concentration | 15% | How much it packs into a few peak hours |

> *"This index estimates parking-related congestion risk from violation patterns. It is **not** a direct measurement of traffic speed."*

## 🛰️ Dataset modes

ClearLane is a platform — it ships **disconnected**, on a clearly-labelled demo sample, and connects to real data in one click.

| Mode | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `sample` | Synthetic demo data, re-seeded each session (the default) |
| `official-aggregates` | The real Bengaluru dataset, connected with one click |
| `uploaded` | Your own CSV — re-aggregated and re-modelled in-app |

## 🌏 Roadmap & future expansion

Today it's Bengaluru. The vision is every Indian city.

## 🚀 Run locally

> 🌐 **Live demo:** [tinyurl.com/ClearLane](https://tinyurl.com/ClearLane) — no setup needed.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 🐳 Run with Docker (one command)

No Node or pnpm needed — just Docker:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

…or with plain Docker:

```bash
docker build -t clearlane .
docker run -p 3000:3000 clearlane
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The image uses Next.js
standalone output, so it stays small and starts fast.

### Verify

```bash
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm build
```

### Rebuild local assets

```bash
pnpm models:generate
GRIDLOCK_PARKING_CSV=/absolute/path/to/dataset.csv pnpm data:build
```

## 🛡️ Responsible by design

ClearLane is honest about what it is — and isn't:

- It measures **recorded violations**, not vehicle speed, occupancy or travel time.
- It **never** issues challans and **never** touches personal or vehicle data (the dataset is anonymised and aggregated to the junction level).
- No claim of years of data, no fabricated "X% congestion reduction", no real-time CCTV.
- Forecasts are model **estimates** with intervals — clearly labelled, never guarantees. Accuracy is reported **out-of-sample** (leave-one-hour-out cross-validation), not the inflated in-sample fit.
